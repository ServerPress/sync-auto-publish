# sync-auto-publish
Automatically Sync Content to Target when Published.

The WPSiteSync for Auto Publish plugin provides the feature to automatically Push the Content you're working on when it is initially Published.

The add-on will perform this automatic synchronization only once: when the Content is first Published. Any subsequent changes to the Content will not be Push automatically.

This add-on will work with the WPSiteSync for Custom Post Types add-on to allow automatic synchronization of Custom Post Type data.

Unlike most of the other WPSiteSync add-ons, this add-on only needs to be installed and activated on the Source site.
